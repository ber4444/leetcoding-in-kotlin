I don't actually need to code these up, instead, it's for system design round. E.g. can say "strategy pattern lets us swap network vs. local-first sync strategies"

Architectural Patterns (highest priority):

MVVM with ViewModel - Android standard, non-negotiable

MVI (Model-View-Intent) - increasingly popular for unidirectional data flow

Repository pattern - data layer abstraction

Observer/Pub-Sub - for reactive UI updates with LiveData/Flow
