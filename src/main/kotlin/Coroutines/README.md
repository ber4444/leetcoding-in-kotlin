*What are Coroutines?*

Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. They are often called 'lightweight threads' because multiple coroutines can run on a single thread, leveraging cooperative multitasking rather than relying on the OS to switch contexts.
