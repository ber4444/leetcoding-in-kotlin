This repo contains solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition (2016, a year after LeetCode and Interviewing.io both came into being; it was the first edition to assume no CS degree)

I also included some other goodies and will include some of the 7th edition (2025, a year after "chain of thought" debut, that is when ChatGPT started solving "hard" problems that it never saw before)

For historical context, CtCi was first published in 2008, when GitHub and the iPhone just launched. She was one of the first voices to successfully argue that companies should stop asking riddles and start testing actual coding and data structure knowledge.
